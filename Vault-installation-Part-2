7. Start the vault server in dev mode and make a note of Unseal key and Root token 
vault server -dev -dev-listen-address=0.0.0.0:8200 >/tmp/vault.log 2>&1 &

8. Get the public ipaddress of ec2 node using below command
curl -s https://ifconfig.me
9. Take the above public ipaddress and access in browser with below URL
http://<Public-ip-address>:8200
10. Login to vault from CLI

Vault installation in production mode – In Linux – with config file :-
===================================================================
Vault Installation with inmem storage:-
--------------------------------------

 - Data stored in memory 
❌ Not suitable for HA setups and Prod 

1. Launch the RHEL EC2 node & login
2. Go to “ cd /tmp ” and download the vault binary file with below command
curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.19.5/vault_1.19.5_linux_amd64.zip
3. Download the unzip package and install
sudo yum install unzip –y
4. Extract the vault zip file
unzip vault_1.19.5_linux_amd64.zip
5. Copy the vault binary file to /usr/local/bin
cp vault /usr/local/bin
6. Validate vault is access anywhere in system now
7. In home directory, create a file vault.hcl

Vi vault.hcl
------------
ui              = true
cluster_addr    = "http://44.210.87.191:8201"
api_addr        = "http://44.210.87.191:8200"
disable_mlock   = true

storage "inmem" {}

listener "tcp" {
  address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable   = true
}



--------
vault server -config=vault.hcl >/tmp/vault.log 2>&1 &

📌 Breakdown:
> redirects stdout to vault.log
2>&1 redirects stderr to the same log file
& runs the process in background


export VAULT_ADDR=http://<public-address>:8200
vault status
vault operator init
vault operator unseal 
vault login


Vault Installation with "file" storage:-
--------------------------------------
1. Launch the RHEL EC2 node & login
2. Go to “ cd /tmp ” and download the vault binary file with below command
curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.19.5/vault_1.19.5_linux_amd64.zip
3. Download the unzip package and install
sudo yum install unzip –y
4. Extract the vault zip file
unzip vault_1.19.5_linux_amd64.zip
5. Copy the vault binary file to /usr/local/bin
cp vault /usr/local/bin
6. Validate vault is access anywhere in system now
7. In home directory, create a file vault.hcl and below folder

mkdir –p /home/ec2-user/vault/data

Vi vault.hcl
------------
ui              = true
cluster_addr    = "http://44.210.87.191:8201"
api_addr        = "http://44.210.87.191:8200"
disable_mlock   = true

storage “file" {
   path = “/home/ec2-user/vault/data”
}

listener "tcp" {
  address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable   = true
}

--------
vault server -config=vault.hcl >/tmp/vault.log 2>&1 &


📌 Breakdown:
> redirects stdout to vault.log
2>&1 redirects stderr to the same log file
& runs the process in background

export VAULT_ADDR=http://<public-address>:8200
vault status
