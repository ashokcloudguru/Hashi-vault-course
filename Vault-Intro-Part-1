Brief explanation of each component in the Vault architecture:-
===============================================================
HTTP/S API: Entry point for clients to interact with Vault using secure requests.
Barrier: Encryption layer that protects all sensitive data; must be unlocked with keys.
Core: Central logic handling operations like initialization, sealing, and leadership.
Token Store: Manages client tokens for authentication and authorization.
Rollback Manager: Reverts to a previous state in case of errors or failures.
Policy Store: Holds access policies defining what actions are allowed for users/tokens.
Expiration Manager: Handles TTL and automatic expiration of leases (secrets, tokens, etc.).
Audit Broker: Forwards request/response logs to the configured audit devices.
Audit Device: Logs all interactions for compliance and monitoring (e.g., file, syslog).
Path Routing: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate backend based on the path.
System Backend: Provides system-level functionalities (e.g., policies, tokens, auth management).
Secret Engine: Handles reading/writing of secrets (e.g., key/value, database, cloud creds).
Auth Method: Authenticates users or machines (e.g., LDAP, GitHub, AppRole).
Storage Backend: Persists Vault's encrypted data (e.g., Consul, Filesystem, S3).
